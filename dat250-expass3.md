## Technical issues

I didn't have any technical issues during installation. I used homebrew for installing MongoDB to MacBook.

## Validation

I validated installation package with PGP and also with SHA-256. Both validations were successful. Screenshots are in expass3 directory.

## Tutorials

I passed through all basic tutorials of MongoDB without problems. Screenshots are in expass3 directory.

## MapReduce

I made MapReduce function for getting average price of order from customer. This can be used in some software for optimization. In application we can have a function which can sort a list of all new orders. Order in the list can be different in many situations but in this case we can put orders with higher price then average on top, so we will be able to send expensive orders faster.

## Pending issues

I don't have any pending issues.
