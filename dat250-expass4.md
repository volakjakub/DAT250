## Technical issues

I didn't have any technical issues with installing JPA, because I didn't use DB for storing todos. I focused more on API implementation so I stored todos in a list.

## Work in assignment

For creating API I used example from exercise 1. It was easy to understand the principles of how to create API with Java Spark. I also did the optional example on Swagger. I made a documentation of API in Swagger and I put it in project repository. I didn't do the optional exercise about XML representation.

## Pending issues

I don't have any pending issues.
