## Software Development Environment

I downloaded Java JDK 11 from original site. Then I chose IntelliJ IDEA as my IDE. I configured it to use the downloaded JDK. In the end I installed Maven through command line. I didn't need to install Git because I already had it from previous projects. All installations were without problems.

## Heroku Experiment

I created account on Heroku. Then I followed orders in tutorial. The tutorial showed me how to deploy app to Heroku and also how to run it locally. I had a little problem with this because a I didn't have installed Postgre database. So I installed it and then everything worked fine. I fully understood the tutorial. Thanks to this tutorial I was able to check my IDE is working properly.
